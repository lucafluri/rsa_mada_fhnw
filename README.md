# RSA programming assignment for mada course FS19

1. The Program can generate RSA Keys in specified size (bitlength).  
They are stored as Key Instances and in the files sk.txt and pk.txt.  

2. The text.txt can be read and encrypted (per character) and saved to cipher.txt

3. Cipher.txt can be decrypted and saved to text-d.txt

All relevant method calls are in the main method. Depending on the desired use some lines must be commented out (i.e. only decrypting cipher.txt).
